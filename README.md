An app for tracking fitness progress

## Scenario - A Day in the Life of Ryan

### Morning
Ryan wakes up feeling a mix of determination and frustration. Last night, Ryan decided it was time to get back into shape. The running shoes are out, a new workout playlist is queued, and a granola bar replaces the usual sugary cereal.

But as Ryan ties the laces, a thought creeps in: “How will I know if I’m making progress?”It’seasy to start strong, but staying consistent has always been the hard part.

### Late Morning
Ryan manages a quick run before heading to work. Itwasn’ta long run—just a couple of laps around the block—but it feels good to get moving.

At work, a colleague mentions their gym routine and howthey’vebeen tracking their progress. “I use an app to log my workouts, but honestly,it’stoo complicated. I end up skipping it half the time,” they say. Ryan nods, thinking about howsimplicityis key.

### Lunch
Over lunch, Ryan starts brainstorming how to track progress. A notebook seems old-fashioned, and most fitness apps seem too cluttered with features.

Ryan jots some notes on a sticky pad:
* “Log workouts.”
* “Track weight or reps.”
* “See progress over time.”

But the sticky note gets lost in the shuffle of other papers. By the time lunch is over, Ryan has forgotten about it.

### Afternoon
Ryan gets a notification from a fitness tracker app installed months ago but neverused.It’san overwhelming reminder about "reaching step goals," “hydration tracking,” and a dozen other things thatdon’tfeel relevant.

Ryan dismisses it and mutters, “I just want something simple to track my workouts.”

### Evening
Back home, Ryan thinks about the day’s run and wonders how to track progress in a way thatdoesn’tfeel like a chore. Should it just be a log of runs? Maybe tracking the time or distance could help show improvement.

Ryan flips through a pile of old notes butdoesn’tfind any inspiration.It’sclearsomething needs to change, but what? For now, the plan is to just keep running and figure it out later.
